    <p>It all started at 8am on Tuesday, 5th of Learnary when I boarded 
        a red train heading to hireable.</p>
    <p>I woke up that morning and was feeling very lazy. However, since I had a very important 
        meeting, I hurriedly did the following to get ready for the day.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Took my bath</li>
            <li>Had a cup of coffee</li>
            <li>Fed my lovely cat, Jenny.</li>
        </ul>
    <p>Then I left my apartment at 7:40am and got to the subway at exactly 7:50am.</p>
    <p>I got my train ticket for just 2 bucks. <a href="https://www.facebook.com/omotroyz">
